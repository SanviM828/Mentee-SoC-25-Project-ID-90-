Snake Game – Classic Arcade Style

Objective:
The objective of this project was to recreate the classic Snake game using Python, as part of the SoC’25 learning journey. This involved learning 
about game loops, event handling, object movement, and collision detection.

Tools Used:
-Programming Language: Python
-Library: pygame
-IDE: VS Code 

Game Description:
The Snake Game is a simple arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game 
ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.

Features Implemented:
-Snake Movement: Controlled using arrow keys. The snake continuously moves in the current direction and turns based on user input.
-Food Generation: Food appears at random positions on the screen. When the snake eats food, it grows longer.
-Score Tracking: A score is maintained and displayed on the screen, increasing each time the snake eats food.
-Game Over Condition: The game ends if the snake hits the screen boundary or collides with itself.
-Restart Option: Added a restart mechanism after game over i.e. pressing "R" button
-Exit Option: Added a exit mechanism after game over i.e. pressing "Esc" button

Learning Outcomes:
-Learned python
-Gained hands-on experience with pygame and its event loop structure.
-Learned how to handle user input, implement game logic, and detect collisions.
-Understood how to manage game states (running, game over, restart).
-Practiced debugging and improving real-time interactive programs.

Challenges Faced:
-Ensuring smooth movement without skipping frames.
-Handling collisions accurately, especially self-collision.
-Managing snake growth and direction logic cleanly.

Conclusion
This project helped reinforce the basics of Python programming while introducing game development concepts. It was fun to build and debug, and served
as a great starting point for more advanced graphical or interactive projects in the future.
